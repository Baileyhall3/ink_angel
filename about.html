                    <p class="about">
                        Ink Angel Tattoo studio was founded in 2012 by the original Ink Angel - <a href="gayle.html">Gayle</a>.
                        It had always been a dream of hers to open her own tattoo studio one day, after falling in love with art at a young age and then working in several
                        tattoo studios before starting the Ink Angel project.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about">
                        Together with her brother <a href="kyle.html">Kyle</a>, who took ownership of the studio in 2023, Ink angel quickly established
                        themselves as one of the most reputable tattoo studios in South Shields.
